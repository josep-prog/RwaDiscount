## 🎯 Next Steps (What You Need To Do)

### Step 1: Set Up Storage Bucket (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage → Create new bucket
3. Name: "deal-images", make it public
4. Go to SQL Editor → Run contents of supabase_storage_setup.sql
```

### Step 2: Configure Google OAuth (10 minutes)
```bash
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Create OAuth credentials
3. Add your domains (localhost:5173 + future Vercel domain)
4. Copy Client ID & Secret to Supabase Auth settings
```

### Step 3: Test Locally (5 minutes)
```bash
npm run dev
# Test image upload in Create Deal modal
# Test Google sign-in on sign-in page
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Add environment variables
3. Update Google OAuth with production URLs
```

## 🔍 How the Image Upload Works

### User Experience
1. **Merchant clicks "Create Deal"** → Modal opens
2. **Clicks upload area** → File picker opens (works on mobile too!)
3. **Selects image** → Preview appears with "Upload" button
4. **Clicks "Upload"** → Image uploads to Supabase Storage
5. **Submits form** → Deal saves with image URL

### Technical Flow
```javascript
File Selection → Validation → Preview → Upload to Storage → Get Public URL → Save to Database
```

### Mobile Support
- ✅ **iOS Safari**: Camera + Photo Library access
- ✅ **Android Chrome**: Camera + Photo Library access
- ✅ **All mobile browsers**: Appropriate file picker

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security
- Image uploads are restricted to authenticated users
- Users can only delete their own images
- File type and size validation prevents abuse
- Google OAuth provides secure authentication

### Performance
- Images are served from Supabase CDN
- 5MB upload limit prevents server overload
- Lazy loading of images in deal cards

### Production Ready
- All code follows React best practices
- Error handling for failed uploads
- Loading states for better UX
- Responsive design for all devices

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Image Upload Issues
1. **Check** if storage bucket exists and is public
2. **Verify** storage policies are created
3. **Ensure** user is logged in when testing

### Google OAuth Issues  
1. **Check** Google Cloud Console URLs match exactly
2. **Verify** Client ID/Secret in Supabase
3. **Test** redirect flow step by step

### Need Help?
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Test authentication flow in incognito mode
