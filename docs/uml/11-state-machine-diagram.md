# State Machine Diagram â€” Deal lifecycle

States
- Draft (implicit in UI when editing a new deal)
- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected
- Expired

Mermaid
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Pending
  Pending --> Approved: admin approves
  Pending --> Rejected: admin rejects
  Approved --> Expired: end_date <= now
  Rejected --> [*]
  Expired --> [*]
```

Notes
- Transitions to Expired are time-based checks (queries filter out expired deals).
- Counts (views/saves) are independent of status but only relevant while approved and before expiry.
